# DigitalizerParametrized

Unfortunately, this had to be dual licensed with GNU GPL v2 because of the WIA library.

I want to extend this in the future to skip using the WIA dialog by setting the color space, DPI and scan area. I tested and it works, but the current WIA library code only worked for black and white.
